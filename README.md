# GraphQL + Google Firestore + Apollo Server

⚠️ This repo is unmaintained.

Attempt at implementing a GraphQL API in Google Firestore with Apollo Server. Ultimately the nature
of the data is too relational for NoSQL, but this repo is public merely as reference (you may find
some things, like [utils/limit-depth](./src/utils/limit-depth) useful!).
